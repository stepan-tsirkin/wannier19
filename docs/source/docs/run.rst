Running a calculation
======================

In the new API with the `run` method one can do integration and tabulating
in one run. Also, different parameters may be used for different quantities 
and also same qantities may be calculated with different sets of parameters in one run.
This is done by calling the following function:

.. autofunction:: wannierberri.run
